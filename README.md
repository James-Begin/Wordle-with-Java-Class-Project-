# Wordle-with-Java-Class-Project-

## Description
> Similar to the popular 'Wordle' game created by British programmer Josh Wardle, the game chooses a random 5 letter word, and the user has 6 chances to guess it. After each guess, letters included in the word and in the same position are outlined green, while letters only included in the word are outline yellow.
